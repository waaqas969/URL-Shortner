# URL-Shortner

This project is a straightforward URL shortener created with Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. Users can enter a URL, which is then shortened using an MD5 hash and saved in a dictionary. The shortened URL is shown to the user, who can copy, share, or open it. The Flask app takes care of redirecting from the shortened URL back to the original. JavaScript is used to manage user interactions such as shortening, copying, and sharing.
